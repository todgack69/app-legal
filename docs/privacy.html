  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta">Last updated: March 2026</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Forever Bets ("we," "our," or "the app") is a predictions game for entertainment at weddings, parties, and events. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that information.</p>

  <h2>Information we collect</h2>
  <p>We collect the following information when you use the app:</p>
  <p><strong>Host accounts:</strong> When you sign in as a host, we collect your email address and account credentials to manage your events.</p>
  <p><strong>Guest participation:</strong> When you join an event as a guest, we collect the name you provide and the predictions you submit. No account or email is required for guests.</p>
  <p><strong>Event data:</strong> Event names, dates, locations, questions, and prediction results created by hosts.</p>
  <p><strong>Purchase information:</strong> If you purchase Premium, the transaction is processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We receive a confirmation of your entitlement status but do not collect or store your payment details, credit card number, or Apple ID credentials.</p>

  <h2>Information we do not collect</h2>
  <p>We do not collect precise location data, health data, financial information, contacts, photos, browsing history, or any device identifiers for tracking or advertising purposes. We do not use analytics or tracking tools. We do not serve advertisements.</p>

  <h2>How we use your information</h2>
  <p>Your information is used solely to operate the app — displaying predictions, calculating scores, showing leaderboards, and enabling hosts to manage their events. We do not use your data for advertising, profiling, or any purpose unrelated to the app's core functionality.</p>

  <h2>Third-party services</h2>
  <p>The app uses the following third-party services to function:</p>
  <p><strong>Base44:</strong> Our backend platform for data storage, user authentication, and server functions. Base44 processes and stores event data, guest data, and host account information on our behalf.</p>
  <p><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Manages in-app purchase entitlements for Premium. RevenueCat receives a user identifier and purchase status from Apple to verify your Premium access. They do not receive your personal data or payment details.</p>
  <p><strong>Google Fonts:</strong> We load fonts from Google Fonts to display the app's typography. Google may collect your IP address and basic request data when fonts are loaded. No personal information is shared with Google by the app.</p>
  <p>We do not share, sell, or provide your data to any other third parties.</p>

  <h2>Data retention</h2>
  <p>Event data (including guest names, predictions, and scores) is retained while the event is active and for a reasonable period afterward so hosts and guests can review results. Hosts can delete their events and all associated data at any time from the dashboard. When a host deletes their account, all events, questions, guests, and predictions associated with that account are permanently deleted.</p>

  <h2>Your rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. Hosts can delete their account and all associated data directly within the app under Account settings. Guest data can be deleted by the event host, or by contacting us at the email below. If you would like to request access to or correction of your data, please contact us and we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

  <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
  <p>Forever Bets is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information promptly. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We use commercially reasonable measures to protect your data, including encrypted connections (HTTPS) and secure authentication. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy or how your data is handled, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@foreverbets.app">support@foreverbets.app</a>.</p>
